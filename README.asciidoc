Project management is a formalised and structured method of managing change in a rigorous manner. It focuses on producing specifically defined outputs by a certain time, to a defined quality and with a given level of resources so that planned outcomes are achieved.

The Tasmanian Government Project Management Framework is comprised of the *Tasmanian Government Project Management Guidelines* and supporting Fact Sheets and Templates, developed in collaboration with practising project managers.
